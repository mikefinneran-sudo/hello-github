Hello, GitHub!

This is my first repository created as part of my journey to become a GitHub expert.

I'm learning about:
- Version control with Git
- Collaboration on GitHub
- Best practices for commits
- Pull requests and code review
- Issue tracking and project management

Let's master GitHub together! ðŸš€
